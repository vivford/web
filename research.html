<p>Hello, we are comma.ai</p>

<p>Today, we are releasing some stuff for you. Open stuff. Because we like openness. It's better than closedness. Even been stuck in an elevator? And openness makes the Machine Learning community great.</p>

<p>From this, you should be able to replicate our initial Bloomberg experiments. Why you say? Because we know we will win. And if you do amazing things with this data, you can join the winning team and do more amazing things with even more data. We love data.</p>

<p>Also, our departing intern Eder Santana has a paper for you. Research. With the corresponding source code. At the real forefront of AI. Bigger than self-driving cars. We publish.</p>
<br/>

PS: Zoox, Tesla, Google, and Cruise, we are waiting for your Open releases.
