<h2><a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> Team Lead</h2>
Just a solid programmer who writes great code, can ship, and can encourage others to write great code. Python/C++. Know about release engineering, testing, documentation, and good coding practices.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Simulation/Testing</h2>
Take a comma <a href="https://github.com/commaai/neo">neo</a> running <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a>, point it at a computer running GTA or similar, and have it drive. Write and maintain openpilot <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/devel/selfdrive/test/plant">regression tests</a>. Maintain and improve our internal route replay infrastructure. Python, C++, and React. I think a game developer would be a great fit here.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
Improve our internal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561">segnets</a> and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5539-depth-map-prediction-from-a-single-image-using-a-multi-scale-deep-network.pdf">depthnets</a>. Work on our automatic ground truthing and ML pipeline. Build better models for openpilot and ship them. Know about <a href="http://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, softmax, ground truthing, and Keras.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<br/>
All positions are full time and on site in our beautiful new <b>San Francisco, CA</b> office. Jobs do not have requirements beyond the generic ones on <a href="hiring.html">hiring</a> and writing <b>good code</b>. Just convince me that <b>you can do the task and make it ship</b>. Our stack is largely written in <b>Python</b>, with some C/C++.
