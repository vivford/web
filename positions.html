<h2>Controls/Planning</h2>
We are starting to accumulate a massive amount of data about how cars drive. Currently our driving system <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> is 100% reactive. Add in GPS information, categorize, and drive down the worldwide number of disengagements that appear on MassiveMap (our internal worldwide map of all users).
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Simulation/Testing</h2>
Take a comma <a href="https://github.com/commaai/neo">neo</a> running <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a>, point it at a computer running GTA or similar, and have it drive. Write and maintain openpilot <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/selfdrive/test/plant">regression tests</a>. Maintain and improve our internal route replay infrastructure. Drive and regression test real cars.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Pipeline/MassiveMap</h2>
Infrastructure. Build and maintain the backend of what's soon to be the largest AI data collection machine in history. 1000's of hours of data come in, process them, make them easy for the company to use. Maintain and improve our large map that's soon to be 3D. Provide more value to our <a href="getchffr.com">chffr</a> users.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Firmware/Car Reversing</h2>
Develop the code that runs on our <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/board">interface board</a>. Reverse engineer cars into nice <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/dbcs">DBC files</a>. Add more car support to openpilot.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>Machine Learning Engineer</h2>
Improve our internal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561">segnets</a> and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5539-depth-map-prediction-from-a-single-image-using-a-multi-scale-deep-network.pdf">depthnets</a>. Work on our automatic ground truthing and ML pipeline. Build better models for openpilot and ship them.
<br/><br/><hr/>
<h2>3D Reconstruction</h2>
We have data from tons of sensors that is all correlated. Build a global optimizer for the 3D location of points and the car path. It's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06475">SLAM</a>, but with a lot more imformation than just a video. Then use free <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">satellite data</a> to globally localize it. We are Waze 2.0, building a 3D map of the world.

All positions on site in our beautiful new <b>San Francisco, CA</b> office. Jobs do not have requirements beyond the generic ones on <a href="hiring.html">hiring</a> and writing <b>good code</b>. Just convince me that <b>you can do the task</b>. Our stack is largely written in <b>Python</b>, with some C/C++.
